The execution of Phidias has a lot of similarities with Spade-BDI.

The both of them doesn't come with a description of what is an environment, so I am not capable to run them concurrently.
If I run two agents on two different shell they both are executed on the main thread.

The output of the excution of the example is similar to the following:
```<_MainThread(MainThread, started 139933116962624)>```
