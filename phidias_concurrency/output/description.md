The execution of Phidias has a lot of similarities with Spade-BDI.

The both of them doesn't come with a description of what is an environment, however I can run two agent toghether in a single description file.

The example execution's output seems to run in the main thread:
```<_MainThread(MainThread, started 139933116962624)>```
